## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Restored Laravel Nova 4 support alongside Nova 5 (`laravel/nova: ^4.0 || ^5.0`), covering Laravel 9 through 13
- Made `MultiselectFilter::apply()` untyped (`apply(NovaRequest $request, $query, $value)`) so the abstract filter is LSP-compatible with both Nova 4 (untyped `$query`) and Nova 5 (typed `Builder $query`). Child filters must use the same untyped signature — do not type-hint `$query`/`$value` or add a return type
- Widened `outl1ne/nova-translations-loader` constraint to `^4.0 || ^5.0`
